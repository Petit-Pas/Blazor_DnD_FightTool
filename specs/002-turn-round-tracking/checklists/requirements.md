# Specification Quality Checklist: Turn & Round Tracking

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — resolved by user input
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Q1 resolved**: Turn advancement is fully undoable (Option B). Undo restores previous fighter and re-opens their log block.
- **Q2 resolved**: Turn order is initiative-based (Option C). Fighters act in descending initiative order; ties broken by insertion order.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
